Driving Coupon Acceptance Analysis

This project analyzes the factors that influence whether drivers accept coupons delivered to their mobile phones while driving. The data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk and explores various driving scenarios such as destination, time, weather, passengers, and type of coupon. The objective is to use visualizations and statistical summaries to distinguish between customers who accepted a coupon versus those who did not.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify key factors that determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon. Different scenarios were explored for various types of coupons: less expensive restaurants, coffee houses, bars, takeaways, and more expensive restaurants.

Key Questions:
How do user attributes like age, income, and behaviors (bar or restaurant visits) influence coupon acceptance?
Does the type of passenger, marital status and the age group of the drivers affect the decision to accept the coupon?

Dataset

The dataset includes the following attributes:

User Attributes: Gender, age, marital status, income, occupation, etc.
Contextual Attributes: Driving destination, weather, temperature, time, and passengers.
Coupon Attributes: Type of coupon (restaurant, bar, coffee house, etc.) and time before it expires.
Deliverables

What is included in this project: 
Visualizations and statistical summaries highlighting the differences between drivers who accept and reject coupons.
Findings published in this repository, which includes insights into key factors influencing coupon acceptance.
Bar charts, histograms, and statistical measures for understanding customer behavior.

Conclusion: 
Drivers who go to bars more than once a month had a higher acceptance rate. I think this suggests that individuals who frequent bars may be more inclined to accept bar related promotions. Also drivers who had passengers other than kids also showed a higher acceptance rate. This might indicate that when people are with friends, partners, or other adults, they are more likely to engage in social activities like going to bars. For coffeehouse coupons, we can see age groups 21 to 31 have the highest coffee house coupons acccetance rate. For the next step analysis, we can look at each individual types of coupons and breakdown different attributes of the drivers to get a deeper understanding of the customer profiles.
